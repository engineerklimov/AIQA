Manuscript Preparation
Manuscripts submitted to our journals must be written in English. Papers accepted for publication vary from 5 to 20 pages in one column format (at least 3000 words but no more than 10000 words, inclusive of references). The main text usually can be divided into separated sections, organized by Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgement, Conflict of Interest, Appendix and Reference.

Figures/Tables should be submitted separately without embedding them in the text to facilitate the revision process

Paper Title
A title of no more than 20 words should be brief, specific, and informative.

Author Details
Full name for all authors should be given; The names of multiple authors are separated by a comma; Provide the full affiliation for each author including academic affiliation (or postal address), city, postcode, country, e-mail(optional); If multiple authors have contributed to the article, details of the corresponding author should be clear. Email address is compulsory for the corresponding author.

Abstract
The abstract should be written as a continuous paragraph with 200-350 words and recapitulatively state the background of the research, purpose, methodologies, principal results, major conclusions and its contributions to the field. It should emphasize new or important aspects of the study. Research limitations/implications, practical implications, and social implications should also be included, if relevant to your manuscripts.

Keywords
3-10 keywords which can accurately reflect the theme of the article should be included for indexing.

Introduction
The Introduction should briefly indicate the objectives of the study and provide enough background information to clarify why the study was undertaken and what hypotheses were tested.

Materials and Methods
Present the research design, research type, research duration, inclusion/exclusion criteria, choice of subjects, etc. Describe the methodology completely, including sample collection, processing, lab analysis, statistical tests used for data analysis etc. Use section headings/subheadings in a logical order to entitle each category or method . (e.g. 1, 2; 1.1, 2.1; 1.1.1, 2.1.1…etc)

Results
Results should be presented in a logical sequence in the text, tables and figures. Repetitive presentation of the same data in tables and figures should be avoided. The results should not contain material appropriate to the Discussion. All tables, graphs, statistical analyses and sample calculations should be presented in this section.

Discussion
Provide an interpretation of your results and make comparisons with other studies. The significance of findings should be clearly described. If your results differ from your expectations, explain why that may have happened. If your results agree, then describe the theory that the evidence supported.

Conclusion
The main conclusions of the experimental work should be presented. The contribution of the work to the scientific research and its economic implications should be emphasized.

Acknowledgements
The acknowledgements section is where you may wish to thank people indirectly involved with the research (e.g., technical support; loans of experimental facilities; comments or suggestions during the creation of the manuscript). However, it is important that anyone listed here knows in advance of your acknowledgement of their contributions. Do not include dedications.

Funding Information
The authors should acknowledge the funders of this manuscript and provide all necessary funding information.

Author Contributions
Authors are required to include a statement of responsibility in the manuscript that specifies the contribution of every author. The level of detail varies; some disciplines produce manuscripts that comprise discrete efforts readily articulated in detail, whereas other fields operate as group efforts at all stages.

Conflict of Interest
A conflict of interest exists when judgment regarding the research is influenced by factors such as financial gain or personal relationships. All authors are required to disclose any financial, personal or other associations that may influence or be perceived to influence, their work.

Appendix
An appendix may be included (and is often helpful) in mathematical or computational modeling.

Tables
Tables should be self-contained and the data should not be duplicated in figures. Tables should be numbered consecutively. Each table should be presented on a separate page with a comprehensive but concise legend above the table. Tables should be double-spaced and vertical lines should not be used to separate columns. Column headings should be brief, with units of measurement in parentheses. All abbreviations should be defined in footnotes. Use superscript letters (not numbers) for footnotes and keep footnotes to a minimum. *, **, *** should be reserved for P values.

TABLE Title
Every table must have a unique title placed at the top. Titles should be clear and concise, and they should not be complete sentences.

TABLE Format
Table tools in Microsoft Word are strongly recommended for inserting a table. It’s necessary to avoid tables created with the tab key.

TABLE Numbering & Citation
Tables in the main body of the text should be numbered and cited consecutively according to their appearance in the text.

Figures
Only necessary illustrations should be included. All illustrations (line drawings and photographs) are classified as figures. Figures should be cited in consecutive order in the text. Figures should be sized to fit within the column or the full text width. Line figures should be supplied as sharp, black and white or color diagrams, drawn with a computer graphics package. Photographs should be sharp and magnifications should be indicated on photographs using a scale bar. Graphics should be supplied as high-resolution (at least 300 d.p.i.) electronic files. Digital images supplied as low-resolution cannot be used and will not be accepted. The legend should incorporate definitions of any symbols used and all abbreviations and units of measurement should be explained so that the figure can be understood without reference to the text.

FIGURE Caption
Each figure should have a caption. The caption should be concise and typed separately, not on the figure area; If figures have parts (for example, A and B), make sure all parts are explained in the caption.

FIGURE Numbering & Citation
All figures are to be sequentially numbered with Arabic numerals. Figures should always be cited in text in consecutive numerical order.

FIGURE Resolution
Figures must be created at a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. For fuzzy or jagged figures, authors are required to replace it or send the original figure file to us for reproduction.

Equations
Equations should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals to avoid ambiguities, if they will be referred to in text. Citation for an equation should be made by using “(1),” not “Eq. (1)” or “equation (1),” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Equation (1) is…”

EQUATION Format
The equation number should be placed in parentheses to the right of the equation. E.g. Hn+1(1/n+1, 1/n+1, …, 1/n+1) (1); Do not create equations as pictures. Use MathType or insert symbols as normal text.

References
It is the Authors responsibility to ensure that the information in each reference is complete and accurate. Only published and “in press” references should appear in the reference list.

REFERENCES Summary
All sources cited in text must appear in the reference list and all items in the reference list must be cited in text.
All references should be listed numerically in the order they've been cited within the paper. At the beginning of each reference, the bracketed number should be included.
REFERENCES In-Text Citation Format
References are simply cited with the consistent reference number in square brackets. Do not set references number as superscript number. Do not use "Ref. [6]" or "Reference [6]" except at the beginning of a sentence, e.g. "Reference [6] shows …"

A. Single Reference
If the author's name appears in the text, place the reference number immediately after the name. E.g. Peter[10] found an innovative scientific phenomenon.

B. Multiple References
Put two numbers in numerical order and separate them by commas but no spaces. E.g.: [2,3] or [2], [3]
Indicate three or more consecutive reference numbers by using the following format. E.g.: [1], [3], [5]; [1] – [5] or [1, 3, 5]; [1-5]
